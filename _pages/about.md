Hi! I'm a Robotics graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, currently pursuing the [Masters in Robotic Systems Development (MRSD)](https://mrsd.ri.cmu.edu/) program. As a part-time researcher at the [Robots Perceiving and Doing Lab, CMU](https://r-pad.github.io/), I work on alternate representations to bounding boxes for 3D object detection.

I'm `seeking full-time positions` in Computer Vision and Machine Learning, `starting June 2023`. I am primarily interested in exploring deep learning-based methods that enable robots to perceive and understand the world around them.
